        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data (called attributes or fields) and code (called methods or functions). OOP helps structure software in a way that is more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Core Concepts of OOP:\n",
        "    * Class\n",
        "       * A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) of the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Object\n",
        "       * An instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with actual values assigned to its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Encapsulation\n",
        "       * Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components (using private/protected access modifiers).\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Inheritance\n",
        "       * Allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass), promoting code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Polymorphism\n",
        "       * The ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways (e.g., method overriding or overloading).\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Abstraction\n",
        "      * Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the structure and behavior that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Points:                     \n",
        "      * A class encapsulates data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on the data.\n",
        "    \n",
        "       * It does not hold any actual data itself until an object (instance) is created from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity created using the class blueprint, containing actual values for the attributes and the ability to perform methods defined in the class.       \n",
        "\n",
        "    - Points:\n",
        "      * A class defines the structure (what data and behavior an object should have).\n",
        "\n",
        "      * An object is a concrete implementation of that class, with its own data.\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Multiple objects can be created from the same class, each with its own state.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - The concepts of abstraction and encapsulation are both fundamental to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes:      \n",
        "  \n",
        " - Abstraction\n",
        "   \n",
        "   * Definition:\n",
        "      * Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Goal:\n",
        "      * To simplify how the user interacts with objects by exposing only what is necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Real-life Example:\n",
        "      * When you drive a car, you only use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift — you don’t need to understand how the engine or brakes work internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * In Code:\n",
        "      * Achieved using abstract classes or interfaces in languages like Java, C++, or Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Encapsulation       \n",
        "\n",
        "   * Definition:\n",
        "     * Encapsulation is the process of binding data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Goal:\n",
        "     * To protect data and ensure it's accessed or modified only in intended ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Real-life Example:\n",
        "     * A medicine capsule hides the internal contents and provides a controlled way to access the medicine.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * In Code:\n",
        "     * Achieved by using private/protected variables and public methods (getters/setters).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder methods in Python, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special methods that have double underscores (__) at the beginning and end of their names. They're also called magic methods or special methods, and they allow you to define how objects of your class behave with built-in Python operations (like printing, adding, or comparing objects).\n",
        "\n",
        " - Examples of Dunder Methods:\n",
        "   * __init__ - Object constructor, called when a new object is created\\\n",
        "\n",
        "   * __str__ - Defines the string representation of the object (used by print())\n",
        "\n",
        "   * __repr__ - Official string representation, used in debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "   * __add__ - Defines behavior for the + operator\n",
        "\n",
        "   * __eq__ - Defines behavior for the == operator\n",
        "\n",
        "   * __len__ - Defines behavior for the built-in len() function\n",
        "\n",
        "   * __getitem__ - Allows indexing into an object like obj[index]\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "  - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a class (called a child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent or superclass).   \n",
        "\n",
        "  - It enables code reuse, extensibility, and helps create a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Key Concepts:\n",
        "    * Parent Class (Base/Superclass): The class whose properties and methods are inherited.\n",
        "    * Child Class (Derived/Subclass): The class that inherits from the parent and can also have additional or overridden methods and attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Benefits of Inheritance:  \n",
        "    * Promotes code reuse\n",
        "    * Encourages modular design\n",
        "    * Allows extension of existing code without modifying it\n",
        "    * Helps implement polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or function call in different ways.    \n",
        "    \n",
        "     * Definition:\n",
        "       * The term polymorphism comes from Greek meaning \"many forms.\" In OOP, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, typically through a shared interface or inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Types of Polymorphism:  \n",
        "\n",
        "     * Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding)\n",
        "       * Achieved through method overloading or operator overloading.\n",
        "       * The method to be executed is determined at compile time.\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)\n",
        "       * Achieved through method overriding.\n",
        "       * The method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type.  \n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to certain parts of an object and bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a class.   \n",
        "\n",
        "  - How Encapsulation is Achieved in Python:    \n",
        "\n",
        "    * Using Access Modifiers:\n",
        "       * Python uses naming conventions to indicate access levels, even though it doesn't enforce strict access controls like some other languages (e.g., Java or C++).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Access Level\n",
        "       * Public , Protected , Private\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Convention\n",
        "       * variable , _variable , __variable\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Description\n",
        "       * Accessible from anywhere , Should not be accessed outside the class/subclass , Name mangled to make it harder to access\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python, the constructor is defined using the special method:           \n",
        "      * def __init__(self):  #initialization code\n",
        "      * __init__ is short for “initialize.”\n",
        "      * self refers to the current object (just like this in other languages).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, both class methods and static methods are used to define methods that aren’t tied to object instances in the usual way, but they serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Class Methods\n",
        "       * A method that receives the class itself as the first argument (conventionally named cls).\n",
        "       * Can access or modify class-level data, but not instance-level data directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Static Methods\n",
        "       * A method that does not receive self or cls as the first argument.\n",
        "       * It’s like a regular function but belongs to a class’s namespace.\n",
        "       * Cannot access or modify class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "   - Method overloading is a concept where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (number or type).       \n",
        "\n",
        "   - Python Doesn't Support Traditional Method Overloading\n",
        "      * Unlike Java or C++, Python does not support method overloading directly. If you define multiple methods with the same name in a class, the last one will overwrite the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - How to Simulate Method Overloading in Python   \n",
        "      * Python uses default arguments, *args, and **kwargs to mimic method overloading behavior."
